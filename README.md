# Social Media Blocker

This project is a simple static site that displays a blocking message. It no longer includes time-based blocking functionality.

## How It Works
- The page always shows a block message, regardless of the time of day.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
3. The page will display a blocking message.

## Deployment
Deploy as a static site on any hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) by uploading `index.html`.

## Notes
- Originally intended to be used with **LeechBlock** as a Tampermonkey script.
- This documentation is for **future me**â€”it is simplified for ease of use.
